This repository accompanies the journal paper:

> **Explainable Audio Emotion Recognition Using High-Resolution Autoencoder and Prototype-Based Deep Learning**  
> *Authors:* Daniel PeÃ±a, Esteban GarcÃ­a-Cuesta.  
> *Journal:* [Name of the Journal], [Year]
> *DOI:* [DOI]  

The repository complements and extends the material included in the article. It also provides the necessary code to run the experiments as well as the explainability results: the learned **prototypes** as spectrograms and as audio signals.
