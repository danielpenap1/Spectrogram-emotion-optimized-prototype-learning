This repository accompanies the journal paper:

> **Explainable Audio Emotion Recognition Using High-Resolution Autoencoder and Prototype-Based Deep Learning**  
> *Authors:* Daniel Pe√±a, Esteban Garc√≠a-Cuesta.  
> *Journal:* [Name of the Journal], [Year]
> *DOI:* [DOI]  

The repository complements and extends the material included in the article. It also provides the necessary code to run the experiments as well as the explainability results: the learned **prototypes** as spectrograms and as audio signals.

## üåê Complementary Webpage

An interactive GitHub Page is provided:

üîó **[https://danielpenap1.github.io/Spectrogram-emotion-optimized-prototype-learning/](https://danielpenap1.github.io/Spectrogram-emotion-optimized-prototype-learning/)**

The page provides the reproducible prototypes foldable sections for each dataset and speaker. It allows:
- Visualization of **learned spectrogram prototypes** per emotion
- Reproduction of **audio prototypes**
